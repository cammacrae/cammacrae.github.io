Hello!

I'm an operations researcher currently located in Windhoek, Namibia, where I'm
lecturing in computer science at the `Namibia University of Science and
Technology (NUST)`_.

I hold a BSc in Computer Science & Philosophy, a Masters in Statistics and Operations
Research, and a PhD in Operations Research.

My research interests include mathematical optimisation, network design
problems, as well as other decision problems. I also have an interest in agent
based simulation and reinforcement learning.

I worked at `carsales.com Ltd.`_ from 1999 (startup) until 2010 (mature, listed company).

I run a lot, and compete in trail races and ultramarathons. I'm coached by `Andy Jones-Wilkins`_.
