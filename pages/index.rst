Hello!

I'm an operations researcher currently located in Melbourne, Australia, where
I'm employed as a staff level researcher working on rail planning
problems at `Navis`_. 

I hold a BSc in Computer Science & Philosophy (Monash), a Masters in Statistics
and Operations Research (RMIT), and a PhD in Operations Research (RMIT).

My research interests include mathematical optimisation, network design
problems, as well as other decision problems. I also have an interest in agent
based simulation and reinforcement learning.

Previously I worked for `Biarri`_, also on rail planning problems, lectured in
computer science at the `Namibia University of Science and Technology (NUST)`_,
was a sessional academic at `Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT)`_,
and held a studentship at `Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research
Organisation (CSIRO)`_ during my PhD. 

I was an early (4th) employee at `carsales.com Ltd.`_ where I worked from 1999
until 2010 (post ASX listing).

I run a lot, and compete in trail races and ultramarathons. I also enjoy
hiking, and motorcycling.

Students interested in pursuing a PhD in operations research under the dual
supervision of `Associate Professor Melih Ozlen`_ and me are encouraged to get
in contact. Funding is typically available for high quality candidates.
