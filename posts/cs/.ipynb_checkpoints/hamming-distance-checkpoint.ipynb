    "The Hamming distance is named after the late American mathematician [Richard Hamming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Hamming \"Richard Hamming's Wikipedia Entry\"). Given two sequences of equal length, the Hamming distance measures the minimum number of symbols that must be substituted to transform one string into the other. As such, the Hamming distance is a measure of similarity, or more formally, a measure of the [edit distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edit_distance \"Edit distance Wikipedia entry\") between two sequences.\n",
